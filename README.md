I was wondering what happens if you take an image made up of pixels of random colour and swap the pixels about with thier neighbours to "improve" the 9x9 squates.

By improve I mean reduce the standard deviatiion in colour of the 9 pixels.




a  a  a
a  a  a
a  A  a
b  B  b
b  b  b
b  b  b

If I swap A with B then potentially the spread of colour of the 9 A pixels reduces and the 9 B pixles might reduce too. If there is a net rudction then the image is "improved" if not leave them alone.
